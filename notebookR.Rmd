## Course 1 Readings


### The RStudio Cheat Sheet
The link below will take you to the RStudio Cheat Sheet. This is a very concise explanation of many of the different tools in RStudio. You don't need to learn everything on this sheet, but it is helpful to orient you to RStudio. If you have any questions about any of the menus or buttons in RStudio, this is likely to give you the answer you need.

Review this carefully as you orient yourself with RStudio. I would take at least 20 minutes to do this.

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf

T​his Cheat Sheet was created by RStudio staff and is distributed by RStudio.


### R for Data Science, Chapter 4
In this chapter of their textbook, Wickham and Grolemund walk through some of the basic R commands we covered. Read it here to check your understanding. You should also get comfortable reading this text, because we will come back to it again in this course (and even more if you go on to other courses in this specialization).

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html

### R​ For Data Science, Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Grolemund and Wickham maintain a free to use version of this text at the linked website. A physical copy of the text is available through O'Reilly. Further information can be found at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

### A Note on File Paths
In the next video, we are going to talk about setting your working directory in R and file paths. 

The instructor is using R Studio on a Windows PC.  Everything should still work on a Mac without any problems, but you do need to be aware of the differences between file paths on Windows and Mac.

So, for example, on a Windows PC, a file path might look like this:

"C:/Dropbox/data_viz_coursera"

On a Mac, a file path in R might look like this:

"/Users/Collin/Dropbox/data_viz_coursera"

If you are on a Mac and having trouble typing in paths, in the top menu bar, click Session --> Set Working Directory --> Choose Directory and then browse to the folder where your file is located. This will set the working directory and show you the path to the folder you select. 

This is explained in the video, but to avoid confusion it is helpful to mention it here.

Good luck!

### CCES Data
I​n the videos and exercises to come, you will be working with some data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a major academic survey about American politics. We are working with a random sample of this data from the 2019 study. I have slightly modified these data for teaching purposes. If you want to do any actual analysis with these data, you should download the original data files from the CCES website.

Ansolabehere, Stephen; Schaffner, Brian; Luks, Samantha, 2020, "CCES Common Content, 2019", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WOT7O8, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:34vNKfe/vAMemliFcOkbvw== [fileUNF]


### Cookbook for R: Basic Plots
These links go to pages in the Cookbook for R by Winston Chang. They explain how to make several basic kinds of plots in R. You should read through each of these carefully, even running the code that they use in the examples in your own RStudio script. The Cookbook is another great resource that we will come back to again later in this specialization.

These pages go into some additional detail on how to use these functions beyond what is included in the video, including how to make boxplots using categorical data and how to add regression lines to scatterplots. These are more advanced functions than what we cover in this course, but this is often the case when learning R. Some of the functions have more advanced tools in them that you don't have to learn right away. It's important to not get distracted when trying read this kind of documentation - focus on the parts that relate to what you need to know to finish your specific task, not trying to understand everything at once.

http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Histogram_and_density_plot/

http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Box_plot/  

http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Scatterplot/  


### R for Data Science, Chapter 5
Chapter 5 of R for Data Science provides a walkthrough of the functions that were demonstrated in the video. Now that you have seen these functions in action, go back now and read these materials, possibly in conjunction with viewing the videos again.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html


### Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet
The Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet provides a very concise explanation of the functions we have been using so far, plus some additional functions. Try out these functions with sample data, perhaps the mtcars or iris datasets built into R. You can load those datasets into R using data(mtcars) and data(iris). Practice makes perfect!

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf

T​his Cheat Sheet was created by the RStudio team and is located at Garrett Grolemund's Github page.


### Getting Started with dplyr
The reference page for dplyr on the tidyverse page provides another great walkthrough of the tidyverse functions. Read this carefully for understanding, running the example code on your own computer as you go.

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html

### Learning to Read R Documentation
Now that you have some experience using the functions in the tidyverse, you should start to get some practice finding and reading R documentation for different functions. These two links will take you to the technical documentation for many of the functions we have used so far, plus some additional materials on two-table verbs. One-table verbs manipulate the data in a single table, and two-table verbs are about combining (merging) tables together.

Read these materials carefully, thinking about what we have learned so far. You may want to try some of the new functions on your own, based on the examples in the documentation.

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-one-table-verbs

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-two-table-verbs

### Note on Previewing Figures in R Markdown
In the videos, when the instructor is working in an R Markdown file, the plots will appear in the plot pane in R Studio. 

Your R Studio session may be set up for your output to be previewed inline (underneath your code in the editing pane). To force your plot to appear in the Preview Pane, in R Studio, in the "Tools" menu in the top menu bar, select "Global Options". From there, find the R Markdown section. Uncheck the highlighted box below, and this should cause the preview to appear in the plot pane.



### R for Data Science, Chapter 27
This is the section in R for Data Science that covers R Markdown. It provides a more detailed walkthrough of the material we covered in the lectures. Read this to check your understanding.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html


### R Markdown Cheat Sheet
Like the other cheat sheets we have seen, the R Markdown cheatsheet provides a very concise reference guide to R Markdown. This covers some content we have seen, and some more advanced concepts. Don't worry that we haven't covered everything here - just read to reinforce what we have covered and to remember that this quick reference is available to you.

https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf

T​his Cheat Sheet was created by the RStudio team.



### R Markdown Reference Guide
The R Markdown Reference Guide is the official documentation for R Markdown. You do not need to read all of this, but you should spend some time reviewing it and familiarizing yourself with this as reference material.

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.htm


### R Markdown: The Definitive Guide
https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html  

This is a selection from the much longer e-book, R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund. The section on "Basics" provides excellent background information. The material in parts 2.1 - 2.6 should be mostly review of what we have covered. You should review what you have learned and acquaint yourself with this great reference tool. 


## Course 2

### Wickham et al, Chapters 1 and 2
These sections of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis provide an important introduction to the ggplot approach for generating graphics.

https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html  

This is an online version of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pederson. Wickham makes the source code for the book available on his Github page, with the compiled version available at the link above. A physical copy of a previous edition is available as a Springer publication.


### ggplot Cheat Sheet
Like the other cheat sheets we have seen, the ggplot cheatsheet provides a very concise reference guide to ggplot. This covers some content we have seen, and some more advanced concepts. Don't worry that we haven't covered everything here - just read to reinforce what we have covered and to remember that this quick reference is available to you.

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf  

This Cheat Sheet was developed by the RStudio team.

### ggplot2 Overview and Reference
The official documention to ggplot2 is extremely useful, providing a quick introduction to ggplot and a comprehensive inventory, explanation, and demonstration of ggplot2 commands. You don't need to read all of this right now, but you should familiarize yourself with it and be prepared to refer to if you need to clarify how something works.

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html  

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html  

### R Graphics Cookbook - Scatter Plots
The R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang is a very valuable quick reference for many different graphics creation tasks. It contains the same basic material as the ggplot documentation, but in a different format that may be easier for some learners to use. Again, you should not read these to retain all of the details, but rather to help you get acquainted with available reference materials.

https://r-graphics.org/chapter-scatter

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-quick-scatter

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-basic-scatter

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-grouped-scatter

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-overplot

Winston Chang makes the 2nd edition of the R Graphics Cookbook available online. A physical copy is published by O'Reilly.

### Sample Data
I​n the videos and exercises to come, you will be working with some data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a major academic survey about American politics. We are working with a random sample of this data from the 2019 study. I have slightly modified these data for teaching purposes. If you want to do any actual analysis with these data, you should download the original data files from the CCES website.

Ansolabehere, Stephen; Schaffner, Brian; Luks, Samantha, 2020, "CCES Common Content, 2019", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WOT7O8, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:34vNKfe/vAMemliFcOkbvw== [fileUNF]

We will also be working with data from the Center for Effective Lawmaking, a research project spearheaded by Alan Wiseman (Vanderbilt University) and Craig Volden (University of Virginia). As with the CCES data, I have slightly modified these data for teaching purposes. To do original analysis, download the original data files from the Center's webpage.

https://thelawmakers.org/data-download

### R Graphics Cookbook - Histograms
These are recipes for histograms from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook:

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-quick-histogram

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-basic-hist#RECIPE-DISTRIBUTION-BASIC-HIST

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-multi-hist#RECIPE-DISTRIBUTION-MULTI-HIST


### R Graphics Cookbook - Box Plots
These are recipes for box plots from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook:

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-quick-boxplot

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-basic-boxplot


### R Graphics Cookbook - Making a Density Plot
These are recipes for density plots from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook:

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-basic-density


### R Graphics Cookbook - Making a Violin Plot
These are recipes for Violin Plots from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook:

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-violin#RECIPE-DISTRIBUTION-VIOLIN


### Bar plots in the R Graph Gallery
The R Graph Gallery is another excellent resource for learning different figure types. This is the page that covers bar plots in ggplot2. You may want to familiarize yourself with other pages on this site - we will come back to it later.

### Cookbook for R - Bar and line graphs
These are recipes for bar and line plots from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook:

(this is from the first edition, whereas other links have been from the second edition)

http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Bar_and_line_graphs_(ggplot2)/  

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/218-basic-barplots-with-ggplot2.html  


### R Graphics Cookbook - Line Graphs
These are recipes for line plots from Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook.

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-quick-line

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-basic-line

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-multiple-line

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-line-appearance

### R Graph Gallery
This is the R Graph Gallery page for making heat maps with ggplot2.

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/79-levelplot-with-ggplot2.html  



### Wickham et al, Chapter 8
Chapter 8 of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis provides an excellent deeper look at how to create annotations. Some of this material is more advanced than what is presented in the lecture videos, but even those methods should be accessible to you if you master what the videos cover.

https://ggplot2-book.org/annotations.html  



### Wickham et al, Chapter 10
Chapter 10 will read like a review for you at this point if you have been following along with the videos, but it will be useful to you now as a way to review the grammar of graphics.

ttps://ggplot2-book.org/mastery.html  


Wickham et al, Chapter 16
https://ggplot2-book.org/polishing.html

### C​hapter 16 of the Wickham et al. text provides a detailed walkthrough of the Theme function.

### ggplot2 Themes Documentation
As with other parts of the site, the ggplot2 documentation has a very well presented explanation for how themes work in ggplot2.

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-themes  

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html  

### ggthemes Gallery
This page has a very strange name, but it is an extremely useful visual inventory of different themes included in the ggthemes package. You should get oriented to this page so you know what the different themes look like.

https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/  

### Download Page for Inkscape
https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0/

T​he download page for Inkscape has a link to a get a copy of the software for multiple operating systems. Install on your computer to follow along with the videos.


### Inkscape Tutorial Parts 1-3
Under the "help" menu in the Inkscape menu bar, you will find a section called "Tutorials". The first three tutorials, "Basics", "Shapes", and "Advanced", are good places to begin if you want to deepen you knowledge of Inkscape. You should not view this as required for this course, but it is helpful for when you start using Inkscape for future work.

### Inkscape Manual Quick Start Section
The Inkscape Manual is an extremely useful document that provides a straightforward reference for Inkscape. The Quick Start section provides a walkthrough of several examples. These materials are more focused on drawing new figures than modifying existing figures, so they are more comprehensive than what is really needed for small tweaks to ggplot2 figures, as we do in this course.

http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/index.html  

## Course 3

### Adding Best Fit Lines
This is the section of the R Graphics Cookbook dealing with adding best fit lines to scatter plots.

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-fitlines

Y​ou will also want to review the ggplot2 documentation for geom_smooth and stat_smooth.

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html

### Drawing Scatterplot Matrices
T​his excerpt from Rob Kabacoff's Data Visualization with R covers creating a scattplot matrix using ggpairs().

https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Other.html#scatterplot-matrix

### Correlation Plots
T​his excerpt from Rob Kabacoff's book covers creating correlation plots:

https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Models.html#Corrplot

### Dot Plots
T​his excerpt from the R Graphics Cookbook covers Cleveland Dot Plots.

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-bar-graph-dot-plot

T​his page from the R Graph Gallery covers lollipop plots, which are a closely related kind of dot plot.

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/300-basic-lollipop-plot.html

### Shading in a line plot
T​his excerpt from the R Graphics Cookbook shows how to shade in the area under a line plot using geom_area.

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-area

### Making a stacked area graph
T​his excerpt from the R Graphics Cookbook shows how to make a stacked area graph.

https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-stacked-area


### Making dumbbell charts
T​his excerpt from Kabacoff's textbook covers how to make a dumbbell chart:

https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Time.html#dummbbell-charts

### Making Alluvial Diagrams
T​his is the official documentation from Cory Brunson for the ggalluvial package. It includes a vignette on how to make an alluvial diagram.

https://github.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial


### Packed Circles Figures
T​he R Graph Gallery has an excellent walkthrough of how to make a simple packed circles figure:

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/305-basic-circle-packing-with-one-level.html

### Pie Charts
P​ie charts are frowned upon by many data visualization experts, for reasons that are well described here:

https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html

H​owever, if you must make a pie chart, the R Graph Gallery has accessible examples:

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/131-pie-plot-with-r.html

### Wickham Chapter 7
W​ickham's textbook, ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis has an excellent introduction to spatial figures in Chapter 7. It provides somewhat more detail than what is provided in the lectures.

https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html


### R Graph Gallery for Maps
T​he R Graph Gallery has an extensive set of pages for Maps. For specific examples related to this course, see:

C​horopleth map with R and ggplot2:

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/327-chloropleth-map-from-geojson-with-ggplot2.html

B​ubble map with ggplot2:

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/330-bubble-map-with-ggplot2.html

### A Note on Data for Simple Features Maps
The lecture video for this lesson uses data stored on the local computer. Although you will not have to locate any external data to complete the assignments for this course, if you want to access the .shp and .geojson files that the video uses, you can download them at this link. There are multiple files in each folder.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yb5cfi9h28veph7/AACjBZNBy3ygKvngEJnFzGKda?dl=0

Make sure you set your working directory in the places indicated in the code example, if you want to follow along exactly with those portions of the video.

### Simple Features for R Documentation
E​dzer Pebesma, the author of the sf package, maintains the official documentation. Much of the package is outside the scope of this course, and this could easily be a full specialization in geospatial data science. However, it is good to know where these resources are located, so it is worthwhile to orient yourself.

https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html

### T​he "Articles" section of the website has a guide for getting started. It provides much more detail than is necessary for this course, but is useful background.

https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html

### F​or a truly comprehensive book on Spatial Data Science, Pebesma offers a textbook at 

https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app

### R​yan Garnett has prepared cheat sheet for sf, but again, many of the functions are outside the scope of this course:

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf

### gganimate
Y​ou can find the official documentation for the gganimate package here. The "Getting Started" section has an excellent introduction to making simple animations, and of course the Reference page has a complete explanation for all of the package functions. You'll want to really read all of this carefully if you want to understand how the gganimate functions work together.

https://gganimate.com/  

### A​dditionally, the R Graph Gallery has several nice examples of how to build animations with gganimate:

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/animation.html


### Making ggplot figures interactive with ggplotly()
T​he plotly documention and official website have an excellent series of examples for how to convert ggplot figures to plotly interactive figures, covering nearly every kind of ggplot figure we have created. Take a few minutes and check out a few of these examples. You'll find it's rather straightforward.

https://plotly.com/ggplot2/  

I​f you are inclined to learn more about plotly and want to self-study, the rest of the website is also excellent.

https://plotly.com/r/  

### Animating ggplot figures with ggplotly
T​his excerpt from Carson Sievert's book, Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny, does an excellent job of demonstrating how to make a ggplot figure animated using ggplotly.

https://plotly-r.com/animating-views.html



## Course 4

## Wickham Excerpts
Hadley Wickham's textbook, Mastering Shiny, is a great text that walks you through Shiny development. Wickham goes into greater detail than is provided in the videos, though much of this should be review for you.

For now, read Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.1-3.3. Work through every example and every code chunk.

These chapters provide two key pieces of information for you:

(1) Wickham provides an additional example of a "starter" Shiny app, with some additional comments that help to describe the general patterns in the structure of these apps

(2) Wickham provides an overview of some of the most common input and output functions

By the end of the reading and in conjunction with the videos, you should be comfortable building your own simple Shiny app from scratch.

I am intentionally not reviewing the concept of reactivity for this short course. Reactive programming is a somewhat more advanced concept than what is required when you are first learning Shiny. You may want to revisit this after you've mastered all the other skills we are working on.

https://mastering-shiny.org

### The Shiny Tutorials
These are an extremely detailed set of walkthroughs and tutorials generated by RStudio about Shiny. These materials go into far more detail than the course videos, but if you want to take a very deep dive, they are a great resource. 

Going through all of these materials is unnecessary to grasp the skills needed for this course, but you should spend some time reviewing these materials now, and keep this in your pocket for future refreshing.

https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/  


### The Shiny Cheat Sheet
Like other Cheat Sheets we've seen, the Shiny cheat sheet provides a quick reference for many of the techniques we are working with. Right now, the Cheat Sheet has a lot more on it than what we've covered, but keep it in your back pocket.

https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/cheatsheet.html  

At this point, I would focus on only the first page of the cheatsheet. The second page goes into greater detail that is necessary for the assignments in this course.

### The Shiny Gallery
The Shiny Gallery has an exceptional set of examples of the kinds of applications you can build with Shiny, from very simple beginnings to very complex professional applications.

Additionally, you should note that, when you click on an example in the gallery, you'll see an option on the next page the "Get Code." This allows you to backwards engineer and use example code as a template for your own projects.

 Spend some time looking through these materials to get a sense of what Shiny can do!

https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/  


### Deploying Apps to shinyapps.io
These articles from the  Shiny reference page provide a text-version of the instructions in the video for uploading apps to shinyapps.io. There isn't anything really different here from the videos, but if you want another set of step-by-step directions, this is a good backup.

https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-web.html

https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html

### Shiny Themes
The package shinythemes provides an easy way to apply some pre-baked design themes to your Shiny app. This is much like the ggthemes package, and the implementation is very easy to use.

Review this page to see how it is done, as well as a gallery for themes. Give it a try!

http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/?_ga=2.132961481.679985627.1601843315-1966566028.1601473074

Shiny Reference: Application Layout guide
This is an excellent, extremely clear write up about how to layout a Shiny app. We reviewed much of this in the video, but there are a few other options that you can learn about here. This is absolutely worth your time to review carefully.

https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html  

Make sure that you understand the following:

(1) Sidebar layout

(2) Tabsets

(3) Navlists

(4) Navbar pages

With these four options, you'll be able to complete the assignment for this week.

### Intro to flexdashboard
This is the introduction provided for flexdashboard in the official documentation. It's review for you now, but available for you to check your understanding.

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html 

There are many parts of this page, but focus for now on the page where the link goes. Look at the different layout options and how they are created. We will fill in the gaps with material soon.

After you cover the layouts, you can look at the "Using" tab on the page. This is fairly comprehensive, coving layout, sizing, and also some additional advanced options. 

As you read, remember that you don't need all of this information to make a dashboard. These are all options for layouts. In this course, we are going to keep things fairly simple, so you can keep a narrow focus on the introductory material for right now.

### Xie et al, Section 5.1
R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund has a short section on flexdashboards. It's a useful additional resource. 

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/layout.html

### Dashboard Layouts
The official documentation for flexdashboard has a great explainer on layout options. Some of this is covered in the lecture, and that will be enough to get you started. However, for a deeper explanation, reviewing the reference materials is necessary.

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/layouts.html

### Make sure that you understand these concepts:

(1) Fill vs. scroll vertical layout

(2) Tabsets

(3) Multiple pages

(4) Input sidebar layout

### Shiny and flexdashboard
We cover the basics of integrating Shiny and flexdashboard in the video. Additional and advanced features are explained in the documentation:

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/shiny.html  

### Keep in mind that integrating Shiny and a flexdashboard is really not more complex than including Shiny in a R Markdown report. You only need to 4 things, which are laid out very clearly in the video and reading:

(1) Add runtime: shiny to the header at the top of the document

(2) Add {.sidebar} to the first column of dashboard. Put your input functions in this column.

(3) In the next column, add output by using render functions like renderPlot.

This will get you very far towards making a complete dashboard with Shiny integration. You have more options for advanced dashboards, but just getting this together is the foundation.



## Course 5

### R for Data Science, Data Import
This chapter from Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science provides an overview of how to import data using the readr package. In particular, it provides a litte more information about parsing data at the import stage, but generally the readr functions do a pretty good job of this, and you won't frequently need to use these options. The main thing to know is that there are several different functions for reading different common file types, so be aware of what these are when you are searching for open data.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html


### Data Import Cheat Sheet
The data import cheat sheet from RStudio is a quick reference guide. If you encounter a problem importing data into R, this is the first document you should pull up for help. 95% of the problems you encounter importing data will be resolved by reading this carefully. 

Note that the "Reshape Data" section of this cheat sheet is a bit out of date. gather() and spread() have been replaced by pivot_longer and pivot_wider, so don't be confused when you see this section.

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf

### R Graph Gallery
We've used the R Graph Gallery before, but I'm including it here as a reminder. If you trying to brainstorm what type of figure to use with your data, a great idea is to scroll through the home page. This provides a stylized gallery of different figure types, grouped together by the type of comparisons that are appropriate for each type of figure. A quick skim can be a great source of ideas if you want to add some variety to your project.

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/

### UC Berkeley Data Viz Guide
The guide, produced by the University of California's library system, provides a good set of handy tips and best practices when making visualizations. It also provides links to additional resources that you might want to review. In particular, the section on Choosing a Chart Type can be helpful when you are thinking about different ways to visualizing your data. There are lots of great tips spread throughout the page, which makes it very much worth your time to review.

https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/data-visualization/about

### Duke University, Data Viz Guide
This guide from the Duke University library system provides an additional set of links and resources on data visualization best practices. I include this guide specifically for the section on Visualization Types, which provides another useful gallery of figure varieties that you might use for inspiration when designing your final project.

https://guides.library.duke.edu/c.php?g=289678&p=1930713

### Healy, Chapter 1
Kieran Healy, a sociologist at Duke University, has written a tremendous textbook on data visualization. He maintains a draft version of the text online at the website below, and you can buy a digital or physical copy of the textbook (I strongly recommend you do). An electronic version is available on Amazon, and physical copies are published through Princeton University Press.

The link below will take you to a draft version of Chapter 1 of the textbook. Pay particular attention to the section on "Channels for representing data" and the accompanying figure.

### Clause Wilke text, Chapters 4 and 5
Claus Wilke is a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. He's written across many scientific disciplines, from physics to virology. He also assembled a wonderful textbook compiling his best practices in data visualization. The book is available in digitial or physical versions and is published by O'Reilly.

The text is rather dense, but I would endorse especially Chapter 4 on color scales and Chapter 5, his directory of visualizations. The subsequent Chapters 6-16 provide much more detail about each entry of the directory. This is another outstanding resource if you trying to pick visualization and working to fine tune your plots.

### EEA Guide
The European Environment Agency has done a great job assembling a list of "dos and don'ts" for your data visualizations.

I would think about this as a checklist. Looking at your visualization, have you avoided the don'ts and followed the dos listed here? If so, you are likely making a great visualization.

    Junk Charts

    Junkcharts is a bit of a hall of shame for bad visualizations. It's interesting to peruse and see what kinds of criticisms others have made of visualization "in the wild." 


### stringr Cheat Sheet
The stringr Cheat Sheet from R Studio is, like all cheat sheets, your first go-to for functions in that package.

https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf


### Getting Started with stringr
The stringr reference page provides specific technical help with package functions.

https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/stringr.html


### R for Data Science, Strings
Wickham and Grolemund provide additional coverage of strings in R for Data Science. In particular, you might want to review the short section on Regular Expressions, if you want a little more context for how these work.

### Peng, R Programming for Data Science, Regular Expressions
https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html

Roger Peng's R Programming for Data Science is an excellent text generally, but here I highlight the chapter on Regular Expressions, again if you think there is a situation where you need to apply these in your own work.


### R for Data Science, Ch. 16
R for Data Science covers dates and times in Chapter 16. You should review this in tandem with the cheat sheet.

### Lubridate Cheat Sheet
Again, the R Studio team provides all the basic information you need about Lubridate in its cheat sheet.

https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf


### Lubridate Reference, Intro
The Lubridate reference page is of course a good resource. I would especially consider working through the code in the "Intro" section, which provides a nice illustration of some more advanced features.

https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/articles/lubridate.html

### R for Data Science, Factors
Unsurprisingly, I recommend you read the chapter in R for Data Science on factors to complement that basic introduction from the video. As with the video, the main focus here is reordering and renaming levels of factors to get your visualizations to work the way you intend.

### Introduction to forcats
This is the introduction to forcats from the tidyverse reference page. The new material here is in the section on "Combining Levels", which you might want to review if you have a column of categorical data with many different values. 

https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html
Relational Data
The chapter on Relational Data in R for Data Science provides a more technical walkthrough of key values and joins. You may want to pay special attention to the problem of duplicated keys.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html

### R for Data Science, Tidy Data
As I've mentioned, understanding what "tidy data" means can be a little difficult if you are new to using R. Wickham and Grolemund do a good job of walking through this very carefully in this chapter of R for Data Science.
