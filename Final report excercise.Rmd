## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



Problem 1
Create a vector of five numbers of your choice between 0 and 10, save that vector to an object, and use the
sum() function to calculate the sum of the numbers.

```{r p1}
vec<-seq(1:5)
sum(vec)

```

Problem 2
Create a data frame that includes two columns. One column must have the numbers 1 through 5, and the other column must have the numbers 6 through 10. The first column must be named “alpha” and the second column must be named “beta”. Name the object “my_dat”. Display the data.

Put your code and solution here:

```{r p2}
a=c(1:5)
b=c(6:10)
my_dat=data.frame("alpha"=a,"beta"=b)
my_dat
```

Problem 3
Using the data frame created in Problem 2, use the summary() command a create a five-number summary for the column named “beta”.

Put your code and solution here:

```{r p3}
summary(my_dat$beta)

```

Problem 4
There is code for importing the example survey data that will run automatically in the setup chunk for this report (Line 13). Using that data, make a boxplot of the Family Income column using the Base R function (not a figure drawn using qplot). Include your name in the title for the plot. Your name should be in the title. Relabel that x-axis as “Family Income”.

Hint: consult the codebook to identify the correct column name for the family income question.

Put your code and solution here:
```{r p4}

```
